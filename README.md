This repository demonstrates a common Swift error: unexpected nil unwrapping during function execution. The `bug.swift` file showcases the problematic code, where a string parameter is implicitly unwrapped without proper nil checking. This can lead to a runtime crash if the parameter is unexpectedly nil. The solution provided in `bugSolution.swift` utilizes a `guard` statement for robust nil handling, preventing the crash and enhancing code stability.  The example emphasizes the importance of defensive programming techniques in Swift to ensure application robustness.
